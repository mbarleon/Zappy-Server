## WARNING

Dear Epitech students, this server was developped in accordance with Epitech's C coding-style (as of 2025), as it was used in my own projects. However, using it directly in your projects may result in a grade penalty (e.g., -42). Use it with caution, and do not add it to your repository unless you have explicit approval from your local pedagogical staff.
